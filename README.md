## Abstract ##
We present a search for binary neutron star mergers during the first observing run of Advanced
 LIGO that produce both gravitational-wave and gamma-ray emission similar to GW170817 and GRB
170817A. We introduce a method to detect sources that do not produce significant gravitational-wave
or gamma-ray burst candidates individually. Searches of this type can increase by 70% the detections
of joint gravitational-wave and gamma-ray signals. We find one possible candidate at a false alarm
rate of 1 in 13 years. If confirmed, this candidate would correspond to a merger at 187+99
−87 Mpc with source-frame chirp mass of 1.30+0.02−0.03 Mpc. If we assume the viewing angle must be < 30◦
to be observed by Fermi-GBM, our estimate of the distance would become 224+88
−78 Mpc. By comparing the rate of
binary neutron star mergers to our search-estimated rate of false alarms, we estimate that there is a 1
in 4 chance this candidate is astrophysical in origin.
